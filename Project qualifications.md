# Project Qualifications

This document outlines what projects qualify as entries.
The goal of this list, in short, is:

**Provide a list of awesome open source projects, that**
**try to improve the world in some fashion, to engineers**
**who want to altruistically participate in those.**

As such, every project will be evaluated based on their
fitness for this goal.
A project that is valid will then be assigned a rank
based on how friendly it is for engineers to participate
in.

## Which projects are allowed in the first place?

In order to provide a sensible list, every project has to
fulfill the following conditions in order to be added:

### 1. The project must accept contributions

This is rather obvious:
If it isn't accepting code from other users, there is no
point in listing it here.

### 2. The project's goal must be the improvement, not money

While it is fine, if the project is backed by a for-profit
organisation, the project itself should not be there to make
more money for it.
Any earning from it should be responsibly used to further
the developement of their solution.

The visitors of this list want to improve the world, not
make some organisation more money in their free time.

### 3. The project's goal must try to improve the lives of people

Previously, it was only defined that it should try to improve
some aspect.
However, that aspect should relate in some way to the improvements
of lives.

This can be through tackling problems like climate change, poverty,
education, human rights or many more.
For example, anything that can be put into one or more
[SDGs](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html)
(Social Developement Goal) is fair game.

### 4. The project must treat contributors with respect

OSS contributors engage in good faith and in their free time.
When choosing a project from this list, they should be able
to expect a welcoming and positive response by the project
itself.

Any form of racism, sexism or other kind of hostility will
disqualify a project from this list.

> In open source projects, the maintainers mostly can't control
> what other members post and this should be taken into account.
> 
> However, the maintainers are expected to act in an adequate
> way onto it.
> Inaction on their part can also be enough for a disqualification.

## What the projects don't have to have

After listing some restrictions, here are some points about what
a project does not have to fulfill.
These were chosen to allow for a wide array of projects to choose
from.

### 1. There are specific license restrictions

Any [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)
license is fair game.

### 2. They don't have to be global

There are no locality restrictions on the projects.
They can operate globally, on a national level or only in a single
city.

### 3. They don't have to be contributor-friendly

Not being easily accessible to contributors will impact the project's
score negatively, but doesn't disqualify it.
Every visitor can decide for themselves, how much time they want
to put into a project.
