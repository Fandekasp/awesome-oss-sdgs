  Reporting sexual assoult or professional sexual coercion can feel isolating
  â€“ or worse, retraumatizing. To some it might also come with some risk.

  Callisto wants to change the equation and empower survivors, provide options
  and allow disclosure in a way that feels save.
  Under its many functionalities, one of them is to securely connect victims of
  the same perpetrator to identify repeat offenders.
